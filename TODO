TODO:
    add a 'silent' option
	clean up environment handling in section
	clean up the setting of "book-title" in Book
	clean up pandoc format handling
    add a flag to signify "this is src, everything else is one level up"
    move to a different (preferably compiled) template system
	add an option to turn off auto-newline-addition

Test:
    on a book where src/ is a file
    with --src="." (how many things does that break?)
    on a book where src is given as multiple/level/src/
    on a book with internally different input formats
    on a book where src/ is above the book
