* Nobody has access to the global title in vars
* Add an author template variable
* Add multi-extensions to themes

TODO:
    rename the profiles dir to targets
    add a 'targets' option
        to limit the targets used
    add context file support
        profiles/context and profiles/*/context
        remove 'author' after having done so
    add config file support
        profiles/config and profiles/*/config
        add support as writer options
    change Config to Environment
        expose targets instead of profiles
        profiles named 'default' should output with the title name
        split 'Options' out of 'Environment'
    make a Book/ namespace
        turn all the functions of [Section] into functions of Position
        make sure that environment starts with the base position
    add a 'silent' option
    add a flag to signify "this is src, everything else is one level up"
    move to a different (preferably compiled) template system

CHECK:
    whether or not we need newlines at the end of templates
        case in point: remove newlines from default.epub md files?
Test:
    on a book where src/ is a file
    with --src="." (how many things does that break?)
    on a book where src is given as multiple/level/src/
    on a book with internally different input formats
    on a book where src/ is above the book
